# This is a shader for Minecraft JavaEdition.  
# I edited [PhotonShader by Sixthsurge](https://github.com/sixthsurge/photon).

Below are the changes from the default Photon.

1 Changed the shape of cumulus_congestus.  
2 Adjusted overall color.  
3 Added support for glowing ores.  
4 Fixed problem with particles not glowing.  
5 Added luminous blocks to block.properties. Supported some mods.  
6 Adjusted star color.  
7 Fixed a problem that puddles are not displayed in Iris 1.7.  
8 Added Japanese translation of shader settings.  
9 Smoothed the edges of the sun and moon.  
10 Adjusted INTENSITY of SNELLS_WINDOW.  
11 Reduced the transparency of clouds at night.  
12 Improved motion blur quality.  

Below are features and adjustments we would like to add in the future.  

1 Shader settings for various languages.    
2 Changes the shape of all clouds.  
3 Color light quality improvements (no improvements planned for a while due to my lack of skill).    
4 Shooting star (No plan to add for a while due to my lack of skill.)     
5 The night sky as in the following image (Running the code I wrote to draw the sky as shown in the image causes bugs, so as soon as I find a better way, I will adjust.)
