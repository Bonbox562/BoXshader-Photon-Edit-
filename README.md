2 Adjusted overall color.  
3 Added support for glowing ores.

6 Adjusted star color.  
7 Fixed a problem that puddles are not displayed in Iris 1.7.

9 Smoothed the edges of the sun and moon.  
10 Adjusted INTENSITY of SNELLS_WINDOW.

2 Changes the shape of all clouds.

4 Shooting star (No plan to add for a while due to my lack of skill.)     
5 The night sky as in the following image (Running the code I wrote to draw the sky as shown in the image causes bugs, so as soon as I find a better way, I will adjust.)
